## Bonus: Fibonacci

Your task is to develop a Java program together that implements a function to calculate the so-called 'n-th Fibonacci number'. The Fibonacci numbers are a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The Fibonacci sequence starts with the numbers 0 and 1, and the next numbers are 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, etc.

First, write a test case for the Fibonacci function and ensure that it fails (since the function is not yet implemented). Then, gradually implement the function to pass the test successfully. Write additional tests to ensure that the function works correctly.

At the end, the Fibonacci function should be fully covered by tests.

Go through the steps together. Take turns so that everyone gets an equal chance!

-   Write the first test case for the Fibonacci function (e.g. Test the Fibonacci number for n=0 or n=1).
-   Implement the Fibonacci function so that the first test case passes.
-   Write additional tests to verify different cases of the Fibonacci function.
-   Improve the implementation of the Fibonacci function to make all tests pass.
